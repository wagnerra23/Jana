# Code-based Extension

For developers deploying Dify locally who wish to implement extension capabilities, there is no need to rewrite an API service. Instead, they can use Code-based Extension, which allows for the expansion or enhancement of the program's capabilities in the form of code (i.e., plugin capabilities) on top of Dify's existing features, without disrupting the original code logic of Dify. It follows certain interfaces or specifications to ensure compatibility and pluggability with the main program. Currently, Dify has opened up two types of Code-based Extensions, which are:

* Add a new type of external data tool&#x20;
* Expand sensitive content review policies

On the basis of the above functions, you can follow the specifications of the code-level interface to achieve the purpose of horizontal expansion.
