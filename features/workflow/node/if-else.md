# IF/ELSE

The IF/ELSE Node allows you to split a workflow into two branches based on if/else conditions. In this node, you can set one or more IF conditions. When the IF condition(s) are met, the workflow proceeds to the next step under the "IS TRUE" branch. If the IF condition(s) are not met, the workflow triggers the next step under the "IS FALSE" branch.
