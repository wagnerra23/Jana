# Key Concept

### Node

Nodes are the key components of a workflow. By connecting nodes with different functionalities, a series of operations within the workflow are executed. Nodes are categorized by type:

* Basic Nodes：Start, End, Answer, LLM, Knowledge Retrieval, Applications (coming soon)
* Question Understand：Quesition Classifier，Question Rewriting (coming soon), Sub-question Splitting (coming soon)
* Logic Processing：IF/ELSE, Merge (coming soon), Loop (coming soon)
* Transformation：Code, Template， Variable Assigner, Function Extraction (coming soon)
* Others：HTTP Request
* Tools：Built-in Tools, Custom Tools

### Variables

Variables are crucial for linking the input and output of nodes within a workflow, facilitating the implementation of complex processing logic throughout the process.

* Workflows need to define input variables for initiating execution or conversation.
* Nodes require input variables for initiation; for instance, the input variable for a question classifier typically consists of the user's question.
* Variables referenced within a node can only be those from preceding process nodes to ensure coherence and avoid duplication.
* To prevent variable name duplication, node names must be unique.
* The output variables of a node are fixed by the system and are not subject to modification.

### Differences between Chatflow and Workflow

**Application Scenario Differences**

* **Chatflow**: Targets conversational scenarios and represents an advanced orchestration mode for Chatbot application types.
* **Workflow**: Geared towards automation and batch processing scenarios.

| Answer              | The Answer node is used for streaming output or fixed text replies and can be utilized mid-process. | Not support Answer node                                                                                                  |
| LLM                 | Memory is automatically enabled to store and pass on the history of multi-turn dialogues.           | <p>Not support Memory configuration<br></p>                                                                              |
| Question Classifier | Memory is automatically enabled to store and pass on the history of multi-turn dialogues.           | Not Support Memory configuration                                                                                         |
