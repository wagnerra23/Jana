# End

Defining the Final Output Content of a Workflow Process. Every workflow needs at least one "End" node to output the final result after full execution.&#x20;

The "End" node serves as the termination point of the process, beyond which no further nodes can be added. In workflow applications, execution results are only output when the process reaches the "End" node. If the process involves conditional branching, multiple "End" nodes must be defined.
